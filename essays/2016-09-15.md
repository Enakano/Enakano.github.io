Configuration managment is pretty essential for any big project, and even for medium and small sized projects. Having configuration managment set up for a project opens up an easy and efficient avenue for a team to build and maintain complex programs or applications. It allows mutiple people or teams to have access to different parts, and limits access to the same parts, of a project without allowing conflicts in file version and incidents like accidental overwrites. It also allows the team or team member to verify the changes they commit to a project, so accidental catostrphic losses can easily be avoided. Personally I hvae not worked on projects big enough to merit the use of configuration management, with the exception of some experience in an ICS 212 C/C++ class as part of an assignment, and thus have never personally run into an issue that would require or benifit from having implemented configuration manaagment, but I can easily see the advantages of implementing it in other possible projects in the future.

As far as Github, the most popular cloud based software hosting platform, and Git,  the most popular technology for configuration management, I am of the opinion that Git is popular because of Github, these days at least. In the days before Github was around, as a Linux inspired offshoot project, Git would certainly have been adopted readily by those in the know or those who saw the benifits of the system. But many more people recently, would likely be very familiar with Github independant of Git, I had not heard of nor researched Git before this semester, but knew of Github and its uses for a few years, as an example. Having been exposed to Git and Github, I certainly will be making more use of both of them moving forward in both my acedemic career, and for personal projects. They are solid systems for configuration managment and relatively easy to use.
