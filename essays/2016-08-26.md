From the time when I was little, I always found myself enamoured by computers, the things they could do, and the programs that ran on them. In no small part this was due to the television shows and videogames I would, and still do, watch and play. As with many younger siblings, many of my younger interests came from emulating my older bother, and he would often let me play with his Super Nintendo or watch Star Trek with him. Then one day my dad brought home a new Windows 95 loaded computer, and I would find myself on it every chance I got.

At no point in my childhood did I ever think to myself that I would learn how the games, programs, and technology I so loved actually worked, nor that I might learn how to make programs of my own, in fact throughout highschool and the start of my college career I thought I was destined for digital media and graphical design. All it took was an A+ certificaiton course in my last year of highschool and an intoduction to programming class at UH Manoa and here I am, having learned the basics in a few languages, and starting a what looks to be rigorous and challenging Software Engineering class.

In this class I am excited to have the opportunity to learn more about how to create and design even the simplest of the wonders I watched and interacted with as a kid. Good design, effective teamwork in a coding environment, management, and UI frameworks are a few of the numerous things I hope to learn in this class. Additonally I hope to learn not only an unfamiliar language, Javascript, but to also enhance and further my skills and habits as a developer, and as an added bonus I will hopefully improve upon my technical writing skills. This is only the begining, but I am excited for the adventure ahead.
