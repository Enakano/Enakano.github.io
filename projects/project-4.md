RPS is a classic game of rock, paper, scissors I developed for my ICS 111 class, Fall 2014, using Java. It is a text based version of the game, using the command prompt or an integrated development enviromnet's run input/output log. The game follows the usual rules of rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, etc... taking user input and responding with a computer move. This continues till the player or the computer wins the best two out of three games.
